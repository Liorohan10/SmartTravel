## 🎯 Key Distinctions

### ⭐ Star Rating vs 🌟 Guest Rating

**IMPORTANT:** These are two different metrics!

**Star Rating (`starRating`):**
- Hotel category/classification
- Based on facilities and amenities
- Industry standard (1-5 stars)
- Example: 2-star hotel, 4-star hotel
- Shows: ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Guest Rating (`rating`):**
- Based on actual guest reviews
- Score out of 10
- Reflects guest satisfaction
- Example: 4.9/10, 8.5/10
- Shows: **8.5** /10

**Why They Differ:**
A 2-star hotel (basic amenities) can have a 9.5/10 guest rating (excellent experience for the category). Conversely, a 5-star hotel (luxury amenities) might have a 6.5/10 guest rating (disappointing service despite facilities).
